## Take care of Virtual Hostel Jerry 🐱
### By Playing Mini Cognitive Games

#### Problem:​

Young kids these days often encounter challenges when it comes to maintaining focus on their studies, leading to frequent distractions. Consequently, this distraction tends to adversely impact their academic performance, resulting in lower grades.​

#### ​Our Solution:​

"Love Jerry," our text-based interface game, is designed to function as an educational game for young children. The gameplay begins as a nurturing-your-pet experience, where users manage a set number of credits and a health balance for their virtual pet, in this case Jerry. To enhance their pet's well-being, users must responsibly care for it by feeding it. Obtaining additional food and water requires the expenditure of credits. Engaging in educational mini-games allows users to earn more credits when they successfully complete challenges. ​

#### Our Inspiration
SUTD's adorable hostel cat, Jerry, served as the inspiration for this virtual pet game. The concept originated from a real-life scenario involving one of our team member's younger siblings. This sibling exhibited restlessness and distraction during study sessions. The shared experience motivated us to develop a game specifically aimed at assisting young children like her, providing an engaging solution to enhance focus and learning. ​
